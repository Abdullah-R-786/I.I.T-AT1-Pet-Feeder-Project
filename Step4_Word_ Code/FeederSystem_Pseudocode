#Automatic Pet Feeder Project Pseudocode:

START
System = ON
LOOP continuously (24/7):
 
    Check feeder capacity (current_FeederCapacity)
    IF (current_FeederCapacity) insufficient 
        Log event (log_Capacity)
        Alert staff to refill feeder (alertStaff)
Continue checking capacity until sufficient 
WAIT 1 second


Check current RTC time (currentRTC)
    IF (currentRTC) time = 08:00 OR 08:30 OR 18:00 OR 18:30

    Determine animal to feed based on currentRTC:
        08:00 → Dispense dog food (servoMotor = 45°)
        08:30 → Dispense cat food (servoMotor = 45°)
        18:00 → Dispense dog food (servoMotor = 45°)
        18:30 → Dispense cat food (servoMotor = 45°)

ELSE 
Don’t dispense any food (servoMotor = 0°)
Continue checking current_FeederCapacity AND currentRTC 
WAIT 1 second


    Attempt to dispense food
    IF dispense successful
        Log success (log_DSuccess)
    ELSE
        Log failure (log_DFail)
        Alert staff of failure (alertStaff)
Continue trying to dispense food until success or fix from staff
WAIT 1 second

        
 
    Wait 15 minutes after for food consumption
    Measure bowl weight (measureB_Weight)
    IF food consumed >= 85% of dispensed quantity
        Log success of consumption (logC_Success)
    ELSE
        Log issue (logC_Issue)
        Alert staff that pet not eating properly (alertStaff)
 
    Re-check feeder capacity (current_FeederCapacity)
    Alert staff if refill needed (alertStaff)
 
END LOOP/Start from beginning again
